  <h1>My Frontend Library</h1>
  <p>
    This is a frontend micro-library focusing on 
    data reactivity and HTML data binding. 
  </p>
  <p>
    $NAME gives a small subset of the functionality
    frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue provide 
    while also being less efficient and more infinite-loop
    prone.   
  </p>
  <p>
    It also doesn't really have documentation other than
    this page. I wouldn't recommend using it.
